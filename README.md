# PhaseAttrib
Phase attribute that correlates with gamma ray logs to detect depositional sequences
##  Concept
>  A program to read in a segy file, process each trace by a sliding specified window and computing the phase spectrum and outputting the phase value at the centroid (or peak) frequency. This results in a sample by sample trace, which is then saved as a segy file.

>  It has been observed that the resulting trace correlates nicely with gamma ray logs giving a utility to use the seismic data to generate a psuedo gamma ray log.
